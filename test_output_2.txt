(node:24588) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///F:/Ali/Projects/alionour33/test/web_browser/flask_app/test_sunnybrook.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to F:\Ali\Projects\alionour33\test\web_browser\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
